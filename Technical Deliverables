Assignment DeliverablesPart 1: Database Design (MySQL Schema)This schema is designed to handle candidate data and AI-driven evaluations. It utilizes a VIEW to ensure rankings are always calculated in real-time based on the latest scores.-- 1. Candidates Table
CREATE TABLE candidates (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    full_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    years_experience INT DEFAULT 0,
    primary_skill VARCHAR(100),
    email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

-- 2. Evaluations Table
-- Stores raw scores generated by the AI evaluation engine
CREATE TABLE evaluations (
    evaluation_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    candidate_id INT NOT NULL,
    crisis_management_score DECIMAL(5,2) CHECK (crisis_management_score BETWEEN 0 AND 100),
    sustainability_score DECIMAL(5,2) CHECK (sustainability_score BETWEEN 0 AND 100),
    team_motivation_score DECIMAL(5,2) CHECK (team_motivation_score BETWEEN 0 AND 100),
    ai_summary TEXT,
    evaluation_date TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    FOREIGN KEY (candidate_id) REFERENCES candidates(id) ON DELETE CASCADE
);

-- 3. Rankings View
-- Logic: Weighted Average (40% Crisis Management, 30% Sustainability, 30% Motivation)
CREATE VIEW candidate_rankings AS
SELECT 
    c.id,
    c.full_name,
    e.crisis_management_score,
    e.sustainability_score,
    e.team_motivation_score,
    (e.crisis_management_score * 0.40 + 
     e.sustainability_score * 0.30 + 
     e.team_motivation_score * 0.30) AS composite_score,
    RANK() OVER (ORDER BY (e.crisis_management_score * 0.4 + e.sustainability_score * 0.3 + e.team_motivation_score * 0.3) DESC) as rank_position
FROM candidates c
JOIN evaluations e ON c.id = e.candidate_id;
Part 2: AI PromptsThese prompts are structured to elicit specific, scorable JSON data from an LLM.Prompt 1: Crisis Management EvaluationContext: Senior Operations Director at a high-volume recycling facility.Scenario: A critical conveyor jam occurs simultaneously with a hazardous chemical leak in the sorting bay.Input: [Candidate's Interview Transcript]Goal: 1. Score (0-100) based on triage speed, safety adherence, and clear communication.2. Provide a brief technical justification for the score.Format: JSON { "score": number, "justification": string }Prompt 2: Sustainability Knowledge AssessmentContext: Circular Economy Specialist.Task: Evaluate the candidate's understanding of PET vs HDPE polymer contamination thresholds.Input: [Candidate's Technical Assessment Responses]Goal:Score (0-100) based on scientific accuracy.Identify if advanced sorting technologies were mentioned.Format: JSON { "score": number, "tech_mentions": string[] }Prompt 3: Team Motivation & LeadershipContext: Industrial Psychologist.Task: Analyze leadership approach for a 50-person shift performing repetitive, labor-intensive tasks.Input: [Candidate's Management Philosophy Statement]Goal:Score (0-100) based on empathy, conflict resolution, and labor law awareness.Categorize their leadership style.Format: JSON { "score": number, "style_category": string }
